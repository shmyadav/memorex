Instructions:

You are given a conversation context and a CURRENT MESSAGE. Your task is to extract **entity nodes** mentioned **explicitly or implicitly** in the CURRENT MESSAGE.
Pronoun references such as he/she/they or this/that/those should be disambiguated to the names of the 
reference entities. Only extract distinct entities from the CURRENT MESSAGE. Don't extract pronouns like you, me, he/she/they, we/us as entities.

1. **Speaker Extraction**: Always extract the speaker (the part before the colon `:` in each dialogue line) as the first entity node.
   - If the speaker is mentioned again in the message, treat both mentions as a **single entity**.

2. **Entity Identification**:
   - Extract all significant entities, concepts, or actors that are **explicitly or implicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT MESSAGE.
   - **Exclude** entities mentioned only in the PREVIOUS MESSAGES (they are for context only).

3. **Entity Classification**:
   - Use the descriptions in ENTITY TYPES to classify each extracted entity.
   - Assign the appropriate `entity_type_id` for each one.

4. **Exclusions**:
   - Do NOT extract entities representing relationships or actions.
   - Do NOT extract dates, times, or other temporal information—these will be handled separately.

5. **Formatting**:
   - Be **explicit and unambiguous** in naming entities (e.g., use full names when available).

        Do NOT mark entities as duplicates if:

        - They have similar names or purposes but refer to separate instances or concepts.

            "duplicates": a sorted list of all idx values from EXISTING ENTITIES that refer to duplicates (deduplicate the list, use [] when none or unsure)
        }}

        - Only use idx values that appear in EXISTING ENTITIES.

Extract all factual relationships between the given ENTITIES based on the CURRENT MESSAGE.
Only extract facts that:
- involve two DISTINCT ENTITIES from the ENTITIES list,
- are clearly stated or unambiguously implied in the CURRENT MESSAGE,
    and can be represented as edges in a knowledge graph.
- Facts should include entity names rather than pronouns whenever possible.
- The FACT TYPES provide a list of the most important types of facts, make sure to extract facts of these types
- The FACT TYPES are not an exhaustive list, extract all facts from the message even if they do not fit into one
    of the FACT TYPES
- The FACT TYPES each contain their fact_type_signature which represents the source and target entity types.

You may use information from the PREVIOUS MESSAGES only to disambiguate references or support continuity.

# EXTRACTION RULES

1. **Entity ID Validation**: `source_entity_id` and `target_entity_id` must use only the `id` values from the ENTITIES list provided above.
   - **CRITICAL**: Using IDs not in the list will cause the edge to be rejected
2. Each fact must involve two **distinct** entities.
3. Use a SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE string as the `relation_type` (e.g., FOUNDED, WORKS_AT).
4. Do not emit duplicate or semantically redundant facts.
5. The `fact` should closely paraphrase the original source sentence(s). Do not verbatim quote the original text.
6. Use `REFERENCE_TIME` to resolve vague or relative temporal expressions (e.g., "last week").
7. Do **not** hallucinate or infer temporal bounds from unrelated events.

# DATETIME RULES

- Use ISO 8601 with “Z” suffix (UTC) (e.g., 2025-04-30T00:00:00Z).
- If the fact is ongoing (present tense), set `valid_at` to REFERENCE_TIME.
- If a change/termination is expressed, set `invalid_at` to the relevant timestamp.
- Leave both fields `null` if no explicit or resolvable time is stated.
- If only a date is mentioned (no time), assume 00:00:00.
- If only a year is mentioned, use January 1st at 00:00:00.

           - Return the fact type as fact_type or DEFAULT if NEW FACT is not one of the FACT TYPES.

        3. CONTRADICTION DETECTION:
           - Based on FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES and NEW FACT, determine which facts the new fact contradicts.
           - Return idx values from FACT INVALIDATION CANDIDATES.
           - If no contradictions, return an empty list for contradicted_facts.
